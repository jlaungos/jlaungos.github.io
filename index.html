		<!--Inserts my favorites in some certain aspects-->
		<h4>CMSC 123 is my favorite CMSC subject so far as it had helped me appreciate coding more, especially in a F2F setup, and I became fond of pointers because of that subject.</h4>
		<h4>ETHICS 1 would definitely be my favorite GE so far since it challenged the thought process I had when I was thinking that subject.</h4>
		<h4>I personally think that C is my current favorite language due to last semester's CMSC 123, specifically the pointers and the trees (BST and AVL).</h4>
		<h4>My favorite food is probably barbeque, specifically the "tenga", but I also like burgers and the stereotypical food of this course, Pancit Canton.</h4>
	
		<!--Inserts additional information about myself, specifcally hobbies and childhood dream-->
		<br>
		<h4>My hobbies include playing video games and sports such as Basketball, Volleyball, and Badminton. I also like to watch anime and tech-related videos during my free time.</h4>
		<h4>My childhood dream was to become a Computer Engineer, but I realized that I wanted to focus more on the software part of technology, so I decided to pursue a career in Computer Science instead.</h4>
